We are proud to announce that our paper "Pond: CXL-Based Memory Pooling Systems for Cloud Platforms" has received the **Distinguished Paper Award** at ASPLOS 2023!

This recognition highlights the significance of our work on CXL-based memory pooling systems, which enables efficient memory resource sharing across servers in cloud environments. The Pond system demonstrates how emerging CXL technology can be leveraged to build practical memory disaggregation solutions.

Congratulations to all the authors on this outstanding achievement!
