We are thrilled to announce that Prof. Huaicheng Li has been awarded the prestigious National Science Foundation (NSF) CAREER Award!

The CAREER Award is the NSF's most prestigious award in support of early-career faculty who have the potential to serve as academic role models in research and education. This five-year grant will support Prof. Li's research on next-generation memory systems and their integration into modern computing infrastructure.

The award will fund research focusing on:
- CXL-based memory pooling and disaggregation
- Tiered memory management for heterogeneous memory systems
- Software-hardware co-design for memory-centric computing

This recognition underscores the importance and impact of MoatLab's research in advancing computer systems architecture.
