## About Me

I am an Assistant Professor in the Computer Science department at Virginia Tech (since Fall 2022). I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Chicago in 2020 and completed a 2-year postdoctoral position at CMU Parallel Data Lab (PDL).

My group, MoatLab, works on Computer Systems, with a focus on **Operating Systems, Storage Systems, Memory Systems, and Systems Architecture**. We engage in comprehensive analysis, benchmarking, hacking, design, and implementation of systems to investigate enhanced systems support for modern and emerging hardware, interfaces, and applications. Our primary goals include improving performance, resource efficiency, and programmability.

For more information, see my [CV](https://huaicheng.github.io/cv.pdf) or [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PxZIxpkAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).
